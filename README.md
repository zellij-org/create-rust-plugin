From Zero to "Hello world!" inside a Zellij Rust plugin with one keyboard shortcut.

All you have to do is think of a name for your new plugin and this wizard will:
1. Clone the [`rust-plugin-example`] template repository into a folder by that name in your project directory
2. Create a development workspace for you as a new tab, with your `$EDITOR` and a helper to compile and run your plugin

The only prerequisites are Zellij `0.41.1` and up, and `rust` (with `cargo`) installed on your machine.
